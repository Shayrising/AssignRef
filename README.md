AssignRef is a platform that allows game official's of the Liga de Fútbol Americano Profesional (LFA) to be assigned games, graded based on their performance, tested on their knowledge, and compensated for their work. AssignRef is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code for the test builder feature. 

My role as a software engineer was to implement the functionality of the test builder. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities.

• Designed a test builder form that allows platform administration to quickly and efficiently add
test questions and their corresponding answers to the database in order to test their officials.

• Generated SQL tables and stored procedures, allowing management of test questions, answers
and answer option types, establishing optimal data use and availability.

• Implemented data tables and stored procedures within SQL to connect and process the
requests from the officials to the database, by using joins, foreign-key relationships, and user-defined table types.

• Built domain-models, services, interfaces, and API endpoint controllers in .NET using C# to
optimize a test builder form, linking the frontend to the backend to create a fully functional
form.

• Conducted daily code talks, standup meetings and regular peer reviews with fellow developers
that enhanced the learning environment and improved overall code quality.

• Performed pull requests and multiple successful branch merges through GitHub after
resolving merge conflicts and collaborated with a product development team using Git and
GitHub for source control and repo management.
